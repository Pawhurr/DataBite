## DataBite: All the information you crave

DataBite is an app designed to add spontaneity to evening meals or help make the decision of what to eat.  Users begin by typing in what kind of food or cuisine they are looking for, such as burgers or Italian.  The app then generates a random recipe in that category.  If the user doesn't like what they see, they can search again.  When they feel the recipe looks good, they can click to add the ingredients automatically to a shopping list.  

Once the shopping list is populated, the user can check off items as the purchase them.  Before they go to the store, if they decide they need other items as well, they can maually add items to the shopping list.  Once they are ready to head to the store, they can utilize the built in map to locate the nearest grocery store.
